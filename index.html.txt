      1.<ins>Raajasab:part1</ins> The RajaSaab (titled onscreen as Prabhas's The
      RajaSaab) is a 2026 Indian Telugu-language fantasy horror comedy film[6]
      written and directed by Maruthi, and produced by People Media Factory and
      IVY Entertainment.[7] The film stars Prabhas, alongside Sanjay Dutt,
      Nidhhi Agerwal, Malavika Mohanan (in her Telugu film debut), Riddhi Kumar
      and Zarina Wahab.[8][9] In the film, a man searching for his missing
      grandfather finds himself in a mansion inhabited by a sinister presence.
      The project was officially announced in January 2024, though principal
      photography began earlier in October 2022.[10] The film's music is
      composed by Thaman S, with cinematography by Karthik Palani and editing by
      Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao.[11] The film was theatrically released
      worldwide on 9 January 2026, coinciding with Sankranthi, receiving
      negative reviews from critics, who criticized its weak script, lacking
      substance, and called it an overstretched narrative, without soul and
      logic.[12][13]
